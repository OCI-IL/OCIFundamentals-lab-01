             *Any {instance.compartment.id = '<your_ocid>'}*

        5. Click **Create**

            ![drawing](./SS/step0/create_matching_rule.png)

        6. Next, give the dynamic group permissions by writing one or more policies. To do so, first click **Policies** under **Identity** on the left, and then click **Create Policy**

            4. Switch the **Show manual editor** toggle on and add the following policies:

                    Allow dynamic-group <your_dg_name> to use buckets in tenancy

                    Allow dynamic-group <your_dg_name> to manage object-family in tenancy

            "bucketName": "<BUCKET_NAME>",
            "coll_name": "<COLLECTION_NAME>"
            }

    4. Press on "**i**" key to edit the file and change the following:

        2. **"bucketName":** Replace <BUCKET_NAME> with your bucket's name (inside the quotation marks)
        3. **"coll_name":** Replace <COLLECTION_NAME> with your collection's name (inside the quotation marks)

    5. After you've finished editing, press the "**esc**" key, then **"shift" + ":"** , then write **:wq** and finally press the "**enter**" key to save your changes


7. **STEP 7 : Running The Application**

    3. Run the following command to run the application:

            python3 flask/OCIFundamentalWorkshop-Instance.py

    4. Navigate to the address **http://<your_instance_public_ip>:5000** in your browser and start uploading!


* **If you get the errors "address already in use" or "the server couldnt be started, because another server runs on that port", simply run the following command:**

        sudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -t -i:5000)
